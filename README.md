## Project Overview
The goal of the project is to understand the relationship between open and closed planes, and their roles within space. This project has five phases, from sizing the bounding volume, to acquiring knowledge about visual-, wind-, and thermal comfort in relation to the shape and placement of the walls and the roof, to finalising the design.
